    "During the 2009 H1N1 (Swine Flu) global pandemic, it is estimated that 250K - 280K people died worldwide from the virus between the years 2009 and 2010. While the global pandemic has since dissapated, the H1N1 virus is still very much present throughout the world. Most recently, there have been outbreaks in Malta, Iran and Morocco. It is just as important as ever to ensure that people are getting their H1N1 vaccines, as another global outbreak is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to predict whether or not people will receive the H1N1 vaccination, based on information collected through the 2009 National Health Flu Survey (NHFS) surrounding demographics and vaccine opinions from Americans over the age of six. Using machine learning classification models, we identified the most important factors that influences someones H1N1 vaccination status. The output of these models is intended to help public health agencies identify populations that are less likely to get vaccinated for H1N1, so they can focus their outreach and education efforts where it matters the most."

    "In the US and around the world, the primary functions of public health agencies like the CDC and others include: 1) Educating the public about health concerns and best practices and 2) Providing the public with the necessary tools to maintain public health. As you can see in the chart above from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, there is a significant gap during the 2009 pandemic between the number of vaccines shipped and the number of vaccine doses administered. Predictive machine learning modeling can help public health agencies determine where to ship vaccines and where additional outreach is needed to promote vaccination.\n",

    "For this project, we will be presenting to the CDC and helping them to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What factors determine whether or not someone is likely to get an H1N1 vaccine?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What populations of people require additional outreach and education improve vaccination rates?\n",
